# action-fixme-check

Checks the code base for any `FIXME:` or `FIXME(username):` (with the colon) and
fails the check if any are found. Useful if you want to make sure that you don't
miss any required changes in the code base before merging a PR.

It runs very fast, taking only a few seconds to finish even on a very large
codebase. All files in the repository will be read, including binary files (it
uses `git grep` under the hood).

In your checks list and PR, you get helpful annotations like this:
